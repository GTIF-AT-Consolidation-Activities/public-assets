|Abstract Description|In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the demand for high-resolution spatial weather information. However, temperature forecasts for cities typically rely on prediction models that often include limited information on urban characteristics. At GeoSphere Austria, model approaches are being further developed to realistically represent cities and their impacts within the prediction model, providing more detailed information about weather events in urban areas. Specifically, high-resolution land cover data and additional information are being used to calculate forecasts of temperatures on a 100-meter grid. Based on the produced data, the initiative aims to calculate derived indicators for energy optimization (e.g., heating degree hours, cooling degree hours) and make inferences about weather-related heating and cooling energy consumption. This enables the identification of potential optimizations in energy use.|
|Stakeholder(s)|Local energy providers|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD|
|Expectations|Tool for derived indicators for energy optimization|
|Input Data|NWP predictions of AROME/SURFEX-TEB, building characteristics|
|Pre-processing|High-performance computing|
|Run-time|GeoSphere algorithm |
|Output Information Product|Spatial NWP forecast data is made available for selected Austrian cities|
|GTIF legacy|None|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|WebGIS|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|GeoSphere Austria is planning to build up a system to create the input data in an operational mode. For this purpose, a coordination with government departments will be necessary. The computation of derived indicators shall be commissioned by stakeholders.|
|Deviations/ Reservations|TBC: GeoSphere’s internationalisation strategy of nowcasting services and connected are implementation steps towards FAIR principles|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
