|Abstract Description|Given that the GTIF-AT Demonstrator supports suitability assessments for solar and wind energy and monitors water levels in reservoirs along hydroelectric dams, the core objective of this task is to explore the possibilities of i) integrating existing data on grid capacities of the high-voltage level grid (transmission grid 380kV/220kV/110kV) and ii) enhancement of the functionality of the tool by providing users with geo-located information on the current installed grid capacities in the Austrian transmission grid as well as an outlook into the near future (e.g. the next 10 years).|
|Stakeholder(s)|BMK (Austrian Ministry of Climate Action and Energy), APG, Energy Utility Companies, DSOs|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD|
|Expectations|Using publicly available grid data in combination with Austrian geodata, the aim is to provide users with a quickly accessible and reliable source of information on the transmission grid. As an added value, this information can be considered in conjunction with geo-located renewable energy (RE) potential and future RE expansion plans (see WR05) and provides information to RE- investors, decision makers and grid operators on whether transmission network infrastructure exists or is planned.|
|Input Data|Publicly available geo-referenced data from APG, ÖNIP (Integrierter österreichischer Netzinfrastrukturplan), the ENTSOE´s Ten-Year Network Development Plan (ENTSOE TYNDP); complemented by other open data sources like “Open infrastructure map”;|
|Pre-processing|Plausibility check and consolidation of data|
|Run-time|AIT algorithm, to be deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud|
|Output Information Product|Overview of transmission grid infrastructure with geo-referenced data; Information of current transmission grid capacities with outlook into the near future.|
|GTIF legacy|none|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Open Government portal; digital, searchable map of Austria, made available to users from administrative authorities, business agencies, site developers, the real estate industry and also investors from autumn 2025|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBC: Establishment of a dedicated Performance Agreement (Leistungsvereinbarung) between AIT and the responsible Austrian ministerial department (BMK) from 2026/2027 onwards to enable a regular update of the underlying data and sources.|
|Deviations/ Reservations|The work is limited to transmission grid infrastructure. The second objective, which concerns the optimisation of energy networks under voltage protection (UVP), cannot be covered as in general there is no data available about the distribution grid. If there is EO data related UVP made available during the project, their utilization can be explored.|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|The work is constrained by the availability of transmission grid network data and requires validation from the stakeholder (i.e. APG), which may be reluctant to contribute to this activity. It is anticipated that the stakeholders will be involved at an early stage in the project. Furthermore, the work will be based on publicly available transmission grid data. In the event that the data is not up to date, the most recent year of data will be used.|
