|Abstract Description|Creation of spatially resolved datasets for the wind speed and the power density in different heights above ground (“wind atlas”)|
|Stakeholder(s)|BMK (Austrian Ministry of Climate Action and Energy), federal and provincial governments, administrative bodies of regions and districts,<br>power utilities, wind farm operators and developers|
|Point of Contact (POC)|Bernhard Fürnsinn, BMK|
|Expectations|Database for the assessment of wind energy potential|
|Input Data|WRF model data, orographic and geographic data, terrain roughness and ground cover data (EO satellite derived), calibration datasets from meteorological stations and wind measurements (AuWiPot data) and public wind energy production data (E-Control).|
|Pre-processing|Geo-statistical model for the sub-grid scaling of numerical weather model using geographical data and terrain roughness operated on-premises by Energiewerkstatt|
|Run-time|<p>Look-up applied to model output data</p><p>Algorithm, to be deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud</p>|
|Output Information Product|Spatially resolved data set for the wind speed and the wind power density in different heights above ground.|
|GTIF legacy|Will improve upon and replace existing wind power density data of GTIF-AT Demonstrator Capability “Wind Energy Assessment”. |
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|On-demand provision of wind power density for specified locations via GTIF-AT front end (interactive WebGIS).|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|Wind potential is basically a static quantity and not subject to short- or medium-term physical variation. In the long term perspective (after several years), an update of the wind atlas incorporating improved data bases and future technology developments and trends is highly desirable. Funding of this update should involve the above mentioned stakeholders and is the subject of ongoing discussions.|
|Deviations/ Reservations|Possibility of FAIR principles implementation needs further investigation before it can be confirmed, in particular, concerning transferability of geo-statistical algorithm which needs local WRF data of high quality. Internationalization strategy of Energiewerkstatt is still TBD.|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
