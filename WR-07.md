| - | - |
|Service Owner and Provider(s)|GeoSphere Austria (owner and provider core algorithm), Contact: Cornelia Steiner|
|Abstract Description|Tool for shallow geothermal potential assessment|
|Stakeholder(s)|Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning (ÖROK) - established by the federal government, the Länder and municipalities to coordinate spatial development at the national level Verein Geothermie Österreich (Austrian Geothermal Association) Forschungsnetzwerk soil2heat Ing. Arne Komposch (RGK eU – Ringgrabenkollektor.at) Klima & Energiereferat der Stadt Baden bei Wien|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD (by ÖROK “Commission of Deputies”); Gregor Götzl, EVN|
|Expectations| GeoSphere derives the specific thermal yield of shallow geothermal methods (horizontal collectors, geothermal baskets, ditch collectors)|
|Input Data|Sentinel-1 derived Soil moisture provided by Copernicus Global land Service (direct relation exist to TU Vienna (Bernhard Raml), producer of these data, who also will provide pre-lease of the data with higher quality over Austria, Sentinel-3 Land Surface Temperature from Copernicus Space Data Ecosystem, ERA5-Land Air Temperature from Copernicus Climate Data Store, Harmonized World Soil Database from FAO, other geodata|
|Pre-processing|Relative Soil moisture is derived from input dataset provided by TU Vienna and is operationally available on a 1 x 1 km raster. Through analysis of the temporal first derivative of soil moisture in comparison with the Austrian soil map, methods to gain information about soil composition / soil texture are evaluated.|
|Run-time|GeoSphere algorithm *deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud*|
|Output Information Product|Assessment of thermal yields first of all to individual homeowners and municipalities|
|GTIF legacy|none|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Expanding the existing Web portal Geothermie Atlas https://geothermieatlas.geosphere.at/|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBC: Geothermie Atlas for entire Austria funded by inclusion in Geosphere Austria’s Performance Agreement (Leistungsvereinbarung) with the responsible Austrian ministerial department (BMBWF) from 2026 onwards to be provided and maintained as operationally funded capability.|
|Deviations/ Reservations|Necessary geodata not available across the board. Currently available for Vienna, Salzburg and parts of Styria. Capability can be rolled out to other areas if data are available in future.|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
