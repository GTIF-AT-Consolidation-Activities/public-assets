|GTIF Capability|**Explore support for geothermal energy potential assessment**|
| - | - |
|Service Owner and Provider(s)|GeoSphere Austria (owner and provider core algorithm), Contact: Cornelia Steiner|
|Abstract Description|Tool for shallow geothermal potential assessment|
|Stakeholder(s)|Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning (ÖROK) - established by the federal government, the Länder and municipalities to coordinate spatial development at the national level|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD (by ÖROK “Commission of Deputies”)|
|Expectations|GeoSphere developed an algorithm for shallow geothermal potential assessment on a „plot-of-land-scale“. This calculation routine should be implemented and applied to larger areas of Austria|
|Input Data|Soil moisture, Land Surface Temperature, other geodata|
|Pre-processing|None|
|Run-time|GeoSphere algorithm *deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud*|
|Output Information Product|Assessment yields first of all to individual homeowners|
|GTIF legacy|none|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Expanding the existing Web portal Geothermie Atlas https://geothermieatlas.geosphere.at/|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBC: Geothermie Atlas for entire Austria funded by inclusion in Geosphere Austria’s Performance Agreement (Leistungsvereinbarung) with the responsible Austrian ministerial department (BMBWF) from 2026 onwards to be provided and maintained as operationally funded capability.|
|Deviations/ Reservations|Necessary geodata not available across the board. Currently available for Vienna, Salzburg and parts of Styria. Capability can be rolled out to other areas if data are available in future.|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
