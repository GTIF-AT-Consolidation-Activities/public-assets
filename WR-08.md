|Service Owner and Provider(s)|EEA (provider of BMK energy dashboard “Österreichs Energie-Infoportal” <https://energie.gv.at/> ) EOX (provider of hosting platform & support in front end), Contact: Daniel Santillan|
|Abstract Description|The BMK energy dashboard currently provided current awareness information related to: Current share of renewable energy in electricity generation, Current power supply by energy source, Power supply for the past 30 days, Gas storage level, Ownership of gas storage facilities, Gas storage level per month compared to the previous year. GTIF-AT Capabilities feature data-driven geospatial aggregation of indicators. It will be explored how entanglements and correlations between data sets maintained in both ecosystems can be synergistically achieved.|
|Stakeholder(s)|BMK (Austrian Ministry of Climate Action and Energy)|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD|
|Expectations|Adding the geospatial component to the BMK energy dashboard, Synchronizing indicator information from the BMK energy dashboard into GTIF portal.|
|Input Data|See above under Abstract Description|
|Pre-processing|TBD|
|Run-time|TBD: Indicator generation algorithm, to be deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud|
|Output Information Product|Same as input but spatially disaggregated|
|GTIF legacy|Possible entanglement with GTIF-AT Demonstrator “Energy Transition Micro-Hydropower” and “Solar Energy Assessment”|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Indicator maps of Austria. Can be queried spatially to show areas above user-defined quantiles within the defined area via GTIF-AT front end (interactive WebGIS) or be integrated into BMK energy dashboard.|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBD|
|Deviations/ Reservations|None|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
