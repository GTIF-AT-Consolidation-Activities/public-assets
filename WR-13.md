|Service Owner and Provider(s)|Sistema GmbH (owner), Contact: Stefano Natali; EOX (provider of hosting platform & support in front end), Contact: Daniel Santillan|
|Abstract Description|Creating high-resolution evapotranspiration maps based on Copernicus Sentinel-2 and NASA ECOSTRESS Thermal Infrared data to support urban green spaces to guide vegetation health monitoring capabilities to those areas that have highest relevance to for urban cooling|
|Stakeholder(s)|Grünstattgrau (GSG), a holistic competence centre for greening buildings promoting innovations for the green and smart city of the future and facilitating their implementation. EFB- the European Federation of Green Roof Associations, ÖGREEN- the Austrian Network for Green Infrastructure- und Nature Based Enterprises Naturbasierte Unternehmen | Connecting Nature und ECTP Home. Urban planning authorities, general public|
|Point of Contact (POC)|Susanne Formanek (GSG)|
|Expectations|Support to urban green spaces initiatives to guide vegetation health monitoring capabilities to those areas that have highest relevance for urban cooling|
|Input Data|Time-series Sentinel-2 L1C/L2A, Time series of NASA ECOSTRESS TIR data, ESA Worldcover data (10m), Copernicus DTM data (10 m), in-situ evapotranspiration data for calibration/validation |
|Pre-processing|Spatial disaggregation and conversion into COG, (limited use of openEO API service)|
|Run-time|Data fusion/AI process for multi-sensor evapotranspiration extraction deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud|
|Output Information Product|High-resolution (10m) evapotranspiration maps which can be clipped to selected urban areas and selected by time periods (monthly, bi-monthly, seasonal, annual)|
|GTIF legacy|Relationship to GTIF-AT Demonstrator Capabilities for “Sustainable Cities/ Green Roofs” but no replacement|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|<p>Open Government portal; digital, searchable map of Austria /WebGIS); aggregation possibilities to communes, city districts, downloadable time-series</p><p>Value added algorithm made available as on demand service and onboarded into the ESA NOR</p>|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|As climate adaptation becomes a reality in more countries and cities, including adaptation to higher temperatures, there is a growing market potential for nature-based cooling solutions in cities. Evapotranspiration maps can be created using the same logic in any city in the world, making the solution transferable. Target groups for the evapotranspiration mapping service and solutions are urban planners in authorities or the forestry sector as well as public and private organizations in the fields of agriculture and hydrology.|
|Deviations/ Reservations|Capability will be enhanced/integrated into GTIF-AT Demonstrator **conditional to positive funding decision by FFG** for related proposal in Austrian Digital Zwilling programme *(“*Auswertung der Entwicklung des ET-Prognosedienstes” in project proposed by Sistema with title “Green energy transition: evapotranspiration and renewable energy for Austria GET-ET")|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
