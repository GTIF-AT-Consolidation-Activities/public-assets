|Abstract Description|Wind: A post-processing method converting NWP predictions to wind power using user-provided information, is developed and implemented. Both cases are considered: Users providing all necessary information including power curve and users providing metadata only with the conversion being built on parametric power curves. The conversion of NWP predictions to wind power production needs information on the location of every turbine, type of turbine and turbine metadata such as rotor diameter and rated power. Ideally the respective power curves are provided. Often, stakeholders/users are not able to share those data due to privacy issues. However, using an interface enabling the users to provide this information without the human-in-the-loop for conversion, is a suitable way. Solar: High-resolution short-term forecast of the solar potential, providing the exact and, above all, daily up to hourly data on solar potential.|
|Stakeholder(s)|Austrian Ministry of Research and Education (BMBWF), operators of energy networks, operators of wind parks, general public (owners of photovoltaic systems and electric cars)|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBC, BMBWF|
|Expectations|Open Government nowcasting services|
|Input Data|Wind: NWP predictions e.g. AROME (GeoSphere Austria data hub) or ICON (via DWD ftp); Solar algorithm is based on the BEAM GRID model calculating ground-level radiation intensity and sunshine duration with 100m spatial resolution. The service integrates a high-resolution digital surface model and considers close-up shading effects|
|Pre-processing|Wind: NWP data is extracted at wind farm locations using python and extrapolated to respective hub heights; Solar: None/TBD|
|Run-time|Deployed as container solution on cloud platform|
|Output Information Product|Wind: Text files providing time series of power production per turbine/wind farm; Solar: TBD (resulting from FFG project)|
|GTIF legacy|Substitute of GTIF-AT Demonstrator Capabilities “Solar Energy Assessment” and “Wind Energy Assessment”; Relationship to GTIF-AT Demonstrator Capability “Solar Roofs/ Total electric power production potential - High, Low, Regular Performance”|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Solar and wind nowcasting map of a target region in Austria (COG). Can be queried for the to be expected energy yields for the agreed time window for any location via GTIF-AT front end (interactive WebGIS). Allows querying the to be expected energy; Yields for the agreed time window for any location.|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBC: Inclusion in Geosphere Austria’s Performance Agreement (Leistungsvereinbarung) with the responsible Austrian ministerial department (BMBWF) from 2026 onwards to be provided and maintained as operationally funded capability. The wind energy nowcast algorithm is a candidate for NOR registration (FAIR principle requirement).|
|Deviations/ Reservations|TBC: GeoSphere’s internationalisation strategy of nowcasting services and connected are implementation steps towards FAIR principles|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
