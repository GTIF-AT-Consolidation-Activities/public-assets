| :- | :- |
|Service Owner and Provider(s)|German Aerospace Establishment (DLR), Contact: Mattia Marconcini, Annekatrin Metz-Marconcini; EOX (provider of hosting platform & support in front end), Contact: Daniel Santillan|
|Abstract Description|Existing green roofs, green roofs impact score for selected cities, Percentage GR-Potential Area in relation to Total Roof Area, Potential CO2 reduction from green roof slop < 20°, 45°, 50°, Roofs suitable for Greening; Solar roofs: Existing photovoltaic panels, Total electric power production potential - High, Low, Regular Performance|
|Stakeholder(s)|<p>Urban planning authorities, general public</p><p>Real estate sector</p>|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD|
|Expectations|Support to urban green spaces initiatives with accurate assessments of rooftop characteristics|
|Input Data|DOP RGBI 2018 – 2022 (provided by BML) and ALS DOM 1m (provided by BML), OpenStreetMap building outlines, Landsat Imagery of 2021|
|Pre-processing|Various data collection, homogenisation and format conversion steps|
|Run-time|DLR algorithm (license paid by TBD) deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud|
|Output Information Product|<p>Existing green roofs, green roofs impact score for selected cities, Percentage GR-Potential Area in relation to Total Roof Area, Potential CO2 reduction from green roof slop < 20°, 45°, 50°, Roofs suitable for Greening</p><p>Solar roofs: Existing photovoltaic panels, Total electric power production potential - High, Low, Regular Performance</p>|
|GTIF legacy|Sustainable Cities / Green Roofs Capabilities|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|<p>Open Government portal; digital, searchable map of Austria /WebGIS); aggregation possibilities to communes, city districts, downloadable time-series</p><p>Value added algorithm made available as on demand service and onboarded into the ESA NOR</p>|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBD (by DLR)|
|Deviations/ Reservations|Capability will be enhanced **conditional to the availability of additional (Georeturn DE) funding of algorithm owner DLR** (no Georeturn Austrian GTIF-AT C funds can be allocated to DLR).** |
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
