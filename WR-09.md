|Abstract Description|People movement on roads and in public transport leads to the emission of CO2 and other pollutants. This GTIF-AT Capability aims to facilitate the explorative analysis of mobility data, providing insights into how mobility patterns interact with socio-economic factors and environmental conditions. The Austrian Climate Ministry (BMK) has examined various data sources to describe people’s mobility. This task will utilize and integrate data from these sources, which may have different spatial and temporal resolutions, to comprehensively characterize mobility patterns in conjunction with socio-economic data and air quality parameters. The methods will support various temporal aggregations, enabling analyses of daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns. Furthermore, the mobility data will be combined with Earth Observation (EO) derived air quality parameters to create a comprehensive dataset that informs urban planning, traffic management and environmental policies. The methodology will be explored and demonstrated using example data. Additionally, a joint showcase will be defined in cooperation with ASFINAG, leveraging ASFINAG's real-time traffic data to validate the mobility data sources.|
|Stakeholder(s)|BMK, ASFINAG|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD|
|Expectations|Policymakers and urban planners require data-driven decision support to improve mobility and reduce environmental impacts. The combination of multiple data sources and leveraging state-of-the-art analytics will provide actionable insights that drive sustainable urban mobility solutions.|
|Input Data|Mobility data from different sources (e.g. mobile phone data), air quality parameters (EO), in-situ traffic volume data|
|Pre-processing|None|
|Run-time|Algorithm deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud|
|Output Information Product|comprehensive dataset of mobility patterns in conjunction with socio-economic factors and air quality, enabling detailed temporal analysis and trend identification across different timescales|
|GTIF legacy|Augmentation of GTIF-AT Demonstrator Capabilities for “Human Mobility Patterns” but no replacement|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Open Government portal, digital, searchable map of Austria, made available to users from administrative authorities, business agencies, site developers, the real estate industry and also investors from autumn 2025|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBC: Establishment of a dedicated Performance Agreement (Leistungsvereinbarung) with the responsible Austrian ministerial department (BMK) from 2026 onwards to be provided and maintained as operationally funded capability.|
|Deviations/ Reservations|As no actual data sources have been specified beforehand, it is assumed that all data is provided free of charges, up-to-date, cleaned and cleared, and well formatted. I.e., that the data can be directly used for further processing. Therefore, no effort is taken to improve data quality. Further, no fully functional implementation is provided as part of this offer. Only a concept and a proof-of-concept implementation is provided showing the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen approach. The demonstration is limited to a restricted set of data for a show-case demonstration only.|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|The mobility data sources to be explored and utilized are not specified in the SOW, making it uncertain whether suitable data will be available for the service development. The planned integration of mobility data with socio-economic factors and air quality data depends on the availability and suitability of these input data. The acquisition of alternative data sources as well as cleaning and preparation of the data are constrained by the given budget limits. If ASFINAG does not provide suitable in-situ traffic data, the validation of the mobility data sources cannot be carried out. The same applies for all other data sources. In addition, due to the missing specification of data in the SOW, it cannot be guaranteed that the different data sets provided are fitting each other in geographical and/or timely manner as well as quality (e.g., aggregation level). Therefore, no guarantees can be committed. However, a best-effort approach is provided by AIT. Issues with data availability will be mitigated by approaching BMK and ASFINAG at an early stage of the project. If data sources are not suitable or unavailable, an attempt will be made to find a replacement. If this is also not successful or not feasible, service development is not possible. Instead, recommendations and requirements for data sources are defined and a theoretical concept for the development of a service will be developed.|
