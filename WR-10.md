|Abstract Description|The GTIF-AT enhancement will consist of the deformation monitoring for important infrastructure assets, which are the enablers of the mobility transition. These vital components of the road infrastructure are subject to various hazards. Some of these, such as excessive settlements, scouring or structural deterioration, are often accompanied by early deformations, which may indicate beforehand an approaching damage or even collapse. Thus, monitoring the displacements at the location of crucial civil infrastructure could provide an early warning system for these assets. The European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provides processed Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) data from Sentinel-1 to measure ground movements. This data is to be combined with the geographic coordinates of the road infrastructure and its components such as bridges, to locate the areas of interest.||
|Stakeholder(s)|ASFiNAG Bau Management GmbH (national motorway operator)||
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD||
|Expectations|The satellite monitoring of the critical infrastructure would provide an essential remote method to complete the toolbox of inspection techniques, thus greatly enhancing their opportunities for predictive maintenance. It is intended to demonstrate the concept on a corridor of approximately 20-30 km length at one of the main Austrian road arteries.||
|Input Data|Sentinel-1 data processed by EGMS, Geolocation data of infrastructure assets||
|Pre-processing|None (except for EGMS)||
|Run-time|AIT algorithm deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud||
|Output Information Product|Long-time deformation of infrastructure assets||
|GTIF legacy|none||
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Open Government portal; digital, searchable map of Austria, made available to users from administrative authorities, civil engineering consultants responsible for inspections||
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|The EGMS data as well as the location of road infrastructure is available to ASFiNAG all across Austria, the service can be scaled up to the entire country thereafter. Furthermore, it is possible to include further stakeholders such as ÖBB (national railway operator) or regional road authorities.||
|Deviations/ Reservations|Based on the available data sources the work will focus on the detection of risks for the transport infrastructure based on deformation monitoring. The inherent green areas are currently considered only indirectly due to the lack of readily available data. The concept will be demonstrated on a corridor of approximately 20-30 km length at one of the main Austrian road arteries, can however be scaled up to cover the entire country. TBC: AIT’s internationalisation strategy of nowcasting services and connected are implementation steps towards FAIR principles||
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|The use of infrastructure data at AIT’s disposal is subject to the approval of the main stakeholder ASFiNAG (Austrian motorway operator). As AIT have a close cooperation with ASFiNAG on the subject and they are very open toward new technologies such as satellite monitoring AIT trust that they are willing to support the project. In the highly unlikely event, that they would not wish to take part, regional road authorities or the Austrian railway operator ÖBB could be approached.||
