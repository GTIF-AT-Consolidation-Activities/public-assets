|Service Owner and Provider(s)|Austrian Environment Agency UBA (owner), Contacts: Sabine Rabl-Berger, Gundula Prokop, Gebhard Banko; Fraunhofer (provider core algorithm), EOX (provider of hosting platform & support in front end), Contact: Daniel Santillan|
|Abstract Description|The Austria-wide extent of the fallow land is largely unknown and shall be reliably determined by merging geodata from different sources through AI supported methods|
|Stakeholder(s)|Austrian Conference on Spatial Planning (ÖROK) - established by the federal government, the Länder and municipalities to coordinate spatial development at the national level |
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD (by ÖROK “Commission of Deputies”) or at BMK (Austrian Ministry of Climate Action and Energy)|
|Expectations|A “Fallow Land Dialogue Tool” using satellite data in combination with land use and other Austrian geodata, shall aim at increasing accuracy, identify potential fallow land sites and enrich them with additional information (e.g. accessibility, degree of sealing). The calculation results are needed in coordination with parallel activities for monitoring land use and soil sealing|
|Input Data|Sentinel-2 via CDSE and openEO API, other geodata|
|Pre-processing|None|
|Run-time|Fraunhofer algorithm (license paid by UBA) deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud|
|Output Information Product|Assessment basis based on probabilities for potentially unused industrial and commercial areas|
|GTIF legacy|none|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Open Government portal; digital, searchable map of Austria, made available to users from administrative authorities, business agencies, site developers, the real estate industry and also investors from autumn 2025. Value added algorithm made available as on demand service and onboarded into the ESA NOR|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|Inclusion in UBA’s Performance Agreement (Leistungsvereinbarung) with the responsible Austrian ministerial department (BMK) from 2026 onwards to be provided and maintained as operationally funded capability. The algorithm is a candidate for NOR registration (FAIR principle requirement).|
|Deviations/ Reservations|Capability will be enhanced/integrated into GTIF-AT Demonstrator **conditional to positive funding decision by FFG** for related proposal in Austrian Digital Zwilling programme (“Tool zur Unterstützung des Brachflächendialogs” in project proposed by AIT with title “Forschungstätigkeiten in der GTIF Domäne ‘Kohlenstoffbilanzierung’")|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
