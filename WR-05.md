|Abstract Description|At present, energy plans for different geographical entities are manually created, e.g. by the Austrian Ministry for Climate Action (BMK) or by authorities at the federal or regional level. The core objective of this GTIF-AT Capability implementation is to provide possibilities how EO data can support the creation of such energy plans in a flexible manner – in accordance with stakeholder needs. Currently ongoing studies and analyses related to regional energy planning will serve here as core basis. Of highlight, the ongoing KLIEN study “Erneuerbare Energiepotenziale in Österreich 2030/2040”, led by AIT, will provide geodata on realisable technical potentials of various renewable energies within Austria in future years (2030, 2040), serving as sound basis for such energy planning activities and will be complemented and merged with other relevant geodata like information on land use and spatial planning. In accordance with stakeholder needs, approaches for aggregation and/or disaggregation will be tested and subsequently possibly deployed.||
|Stakeholder(s)|BMK (Austrian Ministry of Climate Action and Energy), Authorities of the Federal States of Austria||
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD||
|Expectations|EO data can support the creation of energy plans, required at distinct geographical layers, in a flexible manner and in accordance with stakeholder needs. ||
|Input Data|Geodata on available potentials of renewable energy sources, currently derived in the KLIEN study “Erneuerbare Energiepotenziale in Österreich 2030/2040”, led by AIT; complemented by other geodata like CORINE land use database, meteorological data, etc.||
|Pre-processing|Expectably none ||
|Run-time|AIT algorithm, to be deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud||
|Output Information Product|Overview on energy supply options for a green transformation in the energy domain at distinct geographical layers (community, region, federal state, etc.) (i.e., listing the current status and realisable technical future potentials of available renewable energy technologies/sources by 2030/2040 in energy and capacity terms)||
|GTIF legacy|none||
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Open Government portal; digital, searchable map of Austria, made available to users from administrative authorities, business agencies, site developers, the real estate industry and also investors from 2026 onwards.||
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBC: Establishment of a dedicated Performance Agreement (Leistungsvereinbarung) between AIT and the responsible Austrian ministerial department (BMK) from 2026/2027 onwards to enable a regular update of the underlying data and sources.||
|Deviations/ Reservations|The planned work focuses on providing an overview on energy supply options for a green transformation in the energy domain at distinct geographical layers (community, region, federal state, etc.), listing the current status as well as realisable technical future potentials of available renewable energy technologies/sources by 2030/2040 in energy and capacity terms as far as applicable in underlying data sources. Complementary data on the demand side is probably applicable at a lower level of detail and accuracy.||
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|This task aims at exploring the possibilities to support the creation of energy plans in a flexible and automatized manner, in accordance with stakeholder needs. How far all stakeholder needs can be fulfilled is currently not assessable.||
