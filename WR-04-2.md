|Abstract Description|Service for assessment of renovation potentials and energy efficiency of buildings supporting sustainable development strategies for the real estate industry, investors, and political stakeholders, considering the current building efficiency and future development potentials. More than 80% of Austrian buildings are over 40 years old and need renovation. Utilizing renovation and efficiency improvement potentials supports renewable energy use, reduces energy losses, and lowers energy consumption, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and the ecological footprint. The GTIF-AT Capability for renovation potentials and energy efficiency in buildings relies on time series data of land surface temperature data from Copernicus satellites, provided by CDSE. A methodology based on satellite data and temperature changes, combined with digital data on the building stock, building class, and cadastral data, will be developed. Available data is analyzed to infer building quality, energy consumption, and renovation potentials. Results are summarized in recommendations including necessary input and output data for the GTIF-AT Demonstrator.||
|Stakeholder(s)|construction sector, political decision-makers at the national and regional levels, building users, funding agencies, banks and financial institutions||
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD||
|Expectations|Using satellite data in combination with the building standard based on publicly available data with the aim to quantify Austrian building stock (based on the example of Vienna) to increase accuracy, identify renovation potentials and enrich it with additional information (e.g. accessibility, renovation standard, development potential for energy efficiency). The evaluations will be based on existing data and algorithms of the project “Baltic GTIF”.||
|Input Data|Sentinel-2 via CDSE and openEO API, available data from the project “Baltic GTIF”, other publicly available data mainly from the city of Vienna||
|Pre-processing|None||
|Run-time|OHB DS algorithmic deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud||
|Output Information Product|Assessment foundation based on probabilities that are analysed for the pilot area in Vienna||
|GTIF legacy|None||
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Potential Open Government portal; digital, searchable map of Austria, made available to users from administrative authorities, business agencies, site developers, the real estate industry and also investors; expected availability of outlets from 2026 on.||
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|Agreement with the ministerial department (BMK) from 2026 onwards to provided, maintained an operationally funded capability. The algorithm is a candidate for NOR registration (FAIR principle requirement).||
|Deviations/ Reservations|The planned work focuses on the evaluation of renovation and energy efficiency potentials of the existing building stock in a pilot area in Vienna considering existing data and algorithms based on other GTIF services. A risk can be seen in the limitation of available or insufficient data in their quality of high-resolution satellite imagery. Alternatively, an acquisition of satellite data from alternative providers or modification of the study area is foreseen in the enhancement.||
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|By using already existing data from various sources, insufficient quality of high-resolution satellite data or limited availability of data sources can be a hurdle. Furthermore, a specific problem could be the withholding location information due to privacy concern. The acquisition of satellite data from alternative providers or modification is foreseen on one hand, on the other hand, to powerful virtual machines can be used to process and analyse data from various sources. The inclusion of relevant stakeholder groups, users, and data providers is therefore foreseen from the beginning. WR05: It is planned to put emphasis on identifying stakeholder needs at an early stage. Doing so shall allow to provide solutions at the highest level of accordance with stakeholder needs under given data limits as well as underlying time/budget-constraints.||
