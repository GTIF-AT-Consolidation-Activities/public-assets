|GTIF Capability|**Comparison feature for cities/regions as part of GTIF UI**|
| :- | :- |
|Service Owner and Provider(s)|EOX (provider of data conversion algorithms, hosting platform & front-end), Contact: Daniel Santillan|
|Abstract Description|Develop of UI feature that allows comparing different variables/indices over administrative units, ranging from NUTS3 down to the smallest admin unit (“zaehlspraengel”, ZSP)). The compared variables/indicators shall be visualised in a statistical widget that uses data visualisation elements (e.g. scatterplots, pie charts, time series) in an interactive manner. The feature shall support comparison of two or many regions as selected by the user. Prepare sustainable cities showcase, that allows users comparing e.g. existing PV panels, total rooftop suitability, green rooftops and green roof impact score. Prepare an energy transition showcase that compares administrative units for indicators in the energy transition domain, e.g. compare the area assessed as suitable for wind/solar renewable expansion, the number of installed wind turbines, or the micro hydropower potential.|
|Stakeholder(s)|BMK (Austrian Ministry of Climate Action and Energy), federal and provincial governments, administrative bodies of regions and districts,<br>power utilities, wind farm operators and developers|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD|
|Expectations|Allow comparison of higher-level administrative units (e.g. comparison von commune data in a province or region)|
|Input Data|<p>Green roofs and photovoltaic roofs detection data</p><p>Wind turbine detections data</p><p>Micro hydropower data</p>|
|Pre-processing|Statistical aggregation of source data on administrative unite levels |
|Run-time|On-the-fly statistical data access |
|Output Information Product|Statistical widgets allowing comparisons of administrative zones data visualisation elements (e.g. scatterplots, pie charts, time series) in an interactive manner.|
|GTIF legacy|In GTIF-AT Demonstrator already available is the selection and comparison of ZSP data for green and photovoltaic roof-top detection e.g. within a commune.|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Open Government portal; digital, searchable map of Austria /WebGIS); aggregation possibilities from NUTS3 down to the smallest admin unit (ZSP). Value added algorithm made available as on demand service and onboarded into the ESA NOR|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|TBD|
|Deviations/ Reservations|None|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
